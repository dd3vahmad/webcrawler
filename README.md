## WebCrawler


This is a simple CLI webcrawler project to further solidify my understanding of the Go routines and channels

I will be using the Breath First Search (BFS) algorithm to crawl the webpages in recursive manner to a depth of about 12 webpages 
(I hope that's enough). I will be parsing the first 700 characters (I hope that's enough too) of each webpage to avoid long 
processing of really large webpages.

I will be learning a lot about Go's cucrrency patters, so without further ado...LFG!!
